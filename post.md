For fans of Magic the Gathering (MtG) this year has been challenging.  Large competitive gatherings have become completely unwise in the face of a global pandemic, and local game stores have been basically shutdown at the order of local and national governments.  The game has always thrived on having local gathering places, and large national & international festivals.  This has resulted in lots of changes, the first being to competitive tournaments, most all of whom have gone online using the popular [MTG Arena](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena) software which promises to be moving to mobile devices by the end of the year.  But for Magic's most popular format, Commander, this software doesn't help because they do not support multiplayer matches yet.

For those who may not be familiar with Commander, it is a casual format of Magic the Gathering in which four players bring decks and battle against one another.  The decks have [specific construction rules](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/commander-format) which must be followed, and result in each player have 100 card decks led by a Legendary Creature or occasionally Legendary Planeswalker.  This format is hugely popular because of its casual format and inclusion of cards from throughout Magic's history.  But with the outbreak of the pandemic, gathering 4 players around a table became impossible except for large families with multiple players.

But human ingenuity is amazing.  Long before the pandemic a Discord server was established called [PlayEDH](https://discord.gg/49NaUvq) which helped players connect with other players around the world.  They would use Discord for voice chat, and poor web conferencing tools to point a Webcam at their playmats so that everyone could see the battlefields.  So there was a community, and as the pandemic took off it exploded with new players.  It moved from 10 virtual tables of players to 45 (as of today).

At the same time, two software developers named Adam and Jon who loved Commander, but had moved away from all their friends who played, took out of private beta a new website called SpellTable.  [SpellTable] changed the game in regards to tooling, providing life tracking, card identification, and all in truly slick elegant design which was under constant development.  Nearly overnight PlayEDH community began to adopt this new website and the combination is amazingly powerful.  Players from all over the world can now get into games with usually less than a 5 minute wait.

So what does it take to get started?  Well there are two types of setups supported:

* Webcam Setup
  * PC or Mac with a Webcam you can point down at your Playmat
  * Internet Connection
  * Connection to PlayEDH Discord Server
  * Browser opened to SpellTable.com
* Phone Setup
  * PC, Mac or Tablet used to connect to Discord & SpellTable
  * Phone with Camera that you can point at your Playmat

Either of these setups will get you playing paper commander games in no time flat, and let you forget that there is a global pandemic keeping us all apart ... for now.  You can even now find Friend and Foe hosting Thursday Night commander pods, but we realize that this isn't the right time for everyone, so when it is please join us, but until then play some online.
